				<h2>An Introduction - Smartpathshala Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
				<p>We are a part of corporate world and education is that ladder which brought us this success. In return we want to contribute something to this society and want to be digitally transformed. It is essential to curve the ancient ways of learning and to pattern them with the latest culture.</p>

				Why We Think So?
				<p>
				The time is far gone when a student had to complete the academic classes at school, then in colleges and then get technically skilled at companies to be the bread winner. Now, companies are approaching to the school level to higher the fresh buds and to train them from that basis to bring a perfect thinker and in this process they will continuously earn.</p>
				<p>
				Our thoughts are dependent on these trends and we try to align kids with them so that when multinational companies step into the schools premises, students shall be ready to answer every possible question. They should be aware well in advance about how they can be independent and could contribute themselves in learning.
				</p>
				<p>
				We approach the schools or learning joints with this simple thought that every student holds the right to earn the basic education for free or the minimum possible cost. For this we have no motive to earn from them rather to establish the facilities which would curve their thoughts towards constructive path.
				</p>
				Do Not Push Your Kids:
				<p>
				Career orientation is a different factor and providing a skill set is completely different. We never want anyone to push their kids on one stream of learning as most of the parents have the mind-set that career is only for earning. We propose to skill the upcoming generation in the technology so that they can earn their living as a side factor (as a freelancer or entrepreneur) and can focus on the career they want to build their future in. Primary target should be interest, earning is something that will be there eventually.
